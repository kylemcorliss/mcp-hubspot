## Components

### Resources

The server exposes the following resources:

* `hubspot://hubspot_contacts`: A dynamic resource that provides access to HubSpot contacts
* `hubspot://hubspot_companies`: A dynamic resource that provides access to HubSpot companies
* `hubspot://hubspot_recent_engagements`: A dynamic resource that provides access to HubSpot engagements from the last 3 days

All resources auto-update as their respective objects are modified in HubSpot.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need a HubSpot access token. You can obtain this by:
1. Creating a private app in your HubSpot account:
   Follow the [HubSpot Private Apps Guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/private-apps/overview)
   - Go to your HubSpot account settings
   - Navigate to Integrations > Private Apps
   - Click "Create private app"
   - Fill in the basic information:
     - Name your app
     - Add description
     - Upload logo (optional)
   - Define required scopes:
     - tickets
     - crm.objects.contacts.write
     - crm.objects.contacts.sensitive.read
     - crm.objects.companies.sensitive.read
     - sales-email-read
     - crm.objects.deals.sensitive.read
     - crm.objects.companies.write
     - crm.objects.companies.read
     - crm.objects.deals.read
     - crm.objects.deals.write
     - crm.objects.contacts.read
   - Review and create the app
   - Copy the generated access token

Note: Keep your access token secure and never commit it to version control.
